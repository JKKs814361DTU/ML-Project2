Our models can be compared to two publications .... et al. and et al.

In both cases our DTC obtained similar results. Our model obatined recall of 51.25\% which is higher than the results by Gonsalves et al.
The specitivity was not improved (82%).

Our logistic regression performed similar to Khdair et al. with 0.6\% higher recall but lower by 0.008 precision.
